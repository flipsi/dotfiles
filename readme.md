sflip's Configuration Files
===========================

These are some configuration files ("dotfiles", "rc files", ...). 

I use git to version control and github to sync them. Feel free to have a look!

There is a directory for each application. The folder structure within does not have to represent the location of the configuration file. Ideally, the files contain the path to the file where the application expects it and the symlink should be.
